## Mapping the spatial-temporal distribution of COVID-19 misinformation on Twitter

Coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19, originated in Wuhan, China, and
quickly spread due to its contagious nature. By the first few months of 2020,
COVID-19 spread worldwide, and many countries around the world began
to implement lockdowns and stay-at-home measures to contain the spread
of the virus. The spread became so widespread that the World Health Organization (WHO) called this a pandemic. At the same time, conspiracy
theories and misinformation related to the origin, spread, and treatment of
COVID-19 began to appear on social media sites like Twitter. This misinformation spread became so widespread that the World Health Organization
(WHO) called this episode an infodemic. This thesis looks into this misinformation spread on a global scale from the largest COVID-19-related dataset
compiled from Twitter and tries to analyze the misinformation spread.
From a massive Twitter dataset, we create an interaction network, replace the provided location with the correct location of a tweet, label tweets
as misinformation based on the conspiracy theories introduced in the COCO
dataset, and observe eight conspiracy categories and their spread on a
global scale. The thesis introduces concepts and techniques beneficial for
future researchers when working with interaction networks on a global
scale.
The major findings and contributions of this thesis are creating an inmemory representation of this large dataset, creating a large interaction
network between countries, and introducing concepts such as Cij , which allows us to investigate how strong or influential a particular Source-Destination
country combination is compared to other Source-Destination Country combinations. We found that the United States and Great Britain occupied
most of the top conspiracy categories, with a few surprises like China to
India being especially high in a few conspiracy categories.
