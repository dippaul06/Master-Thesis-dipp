effects, treatments and subsequently about the Covid-19 vaccines took place on Twitter, a
social media site famous for its real-time commentary of the ongoing news. This misinformation
about COVID-19 is generating in many forms, such as conspiracy theories which

antibacterial actions [3]. Thus, a massive amount of misinformation event is taking place
regarding the Covid-19 pandemic. These misinformation events are spreading like digital
